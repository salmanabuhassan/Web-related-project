-Note that the url brings you to the source code. In order to view the webpage,
you need to click the publish tab and deploy as web app and click test the
latest code.

-For UIA Carpool, there will be several pages, the homepage, although it requires you to
key in your matric card and password, just key in anything e.g (1 for MC,1 for password)
and it will direct you to the next page. The textbox there is just a prototype.
